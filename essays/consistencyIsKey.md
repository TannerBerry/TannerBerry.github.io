*Why do standard practices matter?*

  Almost every company in the world uses “standard practices” and it is because it is critical when it comes to time and efficiency. The same applies to everything, especially coding. Being able to train your hands and eyes to do things in a specific way every time streamlines finding errors and makes the speed at which large portions of your code can be completed. In the world of software development, maintaining consistent and high-quality code is paramount. ESLint is a tool that can aid developers in adhering to default or customized coding standards and catching potential issues early in the development process. When integrated with popular IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, ESLint becomes a valuable companion for developers striving to produce clean, efficient, and error-free code. 

## ESLint and Its Significance

ESLint is an open-source code analysis tool that enforces coding standards and identifies code quality issues in JavaScript and its various flavors. It is customizable, allowing developers to define and enforce their coding standards, and it can be easily integrated into various development environments. One of the most significant advantages of ESLint is its ability to enforce coding standards consistently across a project. This ensures that everyone can adhere to the same style and best practices, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. The only issues I have had thus far have been a slight learning curve on ensuring ESLint is the enabled and the only analysis tool operating on a project, as required for my class. This has been overcome by practice as it is now second nature. ESLint’s customizing abilities allows developers to tailor coding standards to fit their project’s specific requirements. I was intrigued when I found this out, as I wonder if companies in the programming field this do as well, all having unique builds for their analysis tools. My perspective on ESLint and its integration with IntelliJ IDEA is that it is a valuable addition to the development toolkit despite the occasional pains it may bring. The green checkmark symbolizes adherence to coding standards, ensuring code consistency and quality. While the initial setup can be frustrating, issues are outweighed by the benefits of ESLint.

## Final Thoughts

ESLint’s integration with IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful combination that enhances code quality and consistency in software development. The overall usefulness of this tool in maintaining clean, efficient, and error-free code is unmatched thus far in my coding experience. I have found that striving for the green checkmark is a worthwhile endeavor that contributes to the success of projects and the satisfaction of knowing I am building my muscle memory to a successful standard
