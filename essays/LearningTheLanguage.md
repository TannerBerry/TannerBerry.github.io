*New Language, New World.*

So, you just changed your degree to Computer Science, you spent last semester figuring out Java and coming to the reality that there are no jobs being part of a heist crew where you get to say “I’m in” after breaking into some mainframe. Now what? Well, if you’re like me you start to realize the amazing world of programming that you have just stumbled into. An entire world with unique cultures, more languages than you can fathom, and endless possibilities of what you can do. With each language unlocking more possibilities, understanding, and analyzing what each language brings to the table is a vital part of the journey.

## Its on the horizon!

It’s important when viewing something to understand your perspective, where you view it from has a lot to do with how you perceive it, for myself my viewpoint of JavaScript comes from a Java point of view. Java is strict, structured, and mind numbingly tedious. This is great in a sense of clarity and redundancy but also extremely time-consuming and at times restrictive. JavaScript on the other hand takes the “all gas no breaks” approach. Streamlined flexible syntax, arrow functions, and destructuring, JavaScript’s dynamically typed language is a breath of fresh air. It feels intuitive to learn and natural to write in JavaScript. Now my experience with JavaScript is still limited and I also must take into consideration in regard to learning it, the difference in learning techniques I had between it and java.

## Got to be fit to go far

Okay I’m going to learn JavaScript, now I have to break a sweat doing it with “athletic software engineering”? Well, no, but also yes. Athletic software engineering seemed like an incredibly intimidating prospect at first but I’m already seeing the benefits from it. The high intensity, stress, and pressure of ASE quickly brings to light any deficiencies in your abilities and knowledge. The workouts of the day remind me of wind sprints, a form of endurance training where instead of running at a slow constant pace you give it all you have in short bursts. You do these short bursts more and more and soon enough you realize your new “slow constant” is lightyears faster than before. WODs seem to create a familiarity with the pressure and intensity of a test or job interview to the point that you will become numb to intimidation factor of both and be able to keep calm and focus on the tasks at hand and not how nervous you are. It also has an added benefit of being very fulfilling and rewarding, as you are aware of its difficulty and therefore pleased with your completion of it. So far, the accelerated learning rate and confidence I am gaining in a short timeframe on a new language are enough for me to feel confident that this learning style is one I plan to keep in my toolbox in classes.
