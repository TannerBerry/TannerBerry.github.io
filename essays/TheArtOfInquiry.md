*The power of Smart questions.*

With anything in life asking questions is a fundamental aspect of learning and problem solving. However not every question is created equally. Some are vague, terribly framed, or even insulting, while others are clear, informative about the problem, and much easier to answer. The website "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric S. Raymond (http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is a great guide to understanding the importance of asking smart questions. In this essay we will explore the benefits of smart questions and the many pitfalls you can avoid from using them.
In software engineering you often find yourself in collaborative environments, such as opensource software communities or workplace teams where smart questions are vital. They provide efficient problem solving, enhanced learning and demonstrate respect and preparedness. Simply write your question clearly, avoiding grammatical errors and being precise about your problem can save a lot of time and increase the chances of someone being able to help. Finding out what someone is saying should not be the hard part of answering a question so make it easy. In programming you will often run into complex issues where being as precise and informative about your issue is imperative. Doing things like explaining what you have tried to fix it, explaining what environment it is occurring in, or providing any research you’ve done on it can reduce a lot of back an forth and help those answering pin down the problem better. All these and many more are just some of the ways you can transform your questions into smart questions. Below we will go over 2 questions posted on StackOverflow and show some of the differences in asking a question the “smart way” versus the “not smart” way.
In the first question the subject line is “Line spacing with Latex”, not awful but somewhat vague. Is it about how to do line spacing, a problem with line spacing, or something else? The post goes on with many grammatical errors that at times make it need to be re-read to understand. The user then explains that they saw extra spacing while in PDF and 2 lines showing the floormate they want and the one appearing in the PDF. There is no other information on what specifically about the floormat they want changed, or any of the code that would be causing the issue. This leads to 2 types of responses. Firstly one asking for clarification, the code, or a screenshot. The other being more generous gives a very general and vague answer.
